# Classifying Images of Sea Animals

**Project Description:** In this project, I build a convolutional neural network model to classify images of sea animals using the Tensorflow library. 

**Link to Project**: [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/johncarlomaula/sea-animal-classification/blob/main/image_classifier.ipynb)

## Main Goals:
- Prepare the image dataset for modeling
- Build a convolutional neural network model to classify images of sea animals
- Improve the model using various methods such as increasing complexity, data augmentation, and hyperparameter tuning

## Project Summary:

- Key Finding 1
- Key Finding 2
- Key Finding 3
